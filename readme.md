# What is Chell? #

Chell is a really simple shell written in C.

It offers the bare mininum a shell needs to be useful.

# Compiling Chell #
To compile shell, simple type `make` in the root directory. 
This will produce a binary called `chell`.

# Using Chell #

To use chell, simply run it with 
```
./chell
```
or if you want to change the prompt

```
./chell -p "$> "
```

From there, chell works just like any other shell with some caveats that I should elaborate in this file at some point.
